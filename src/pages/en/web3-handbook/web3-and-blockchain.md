Learn what people mean when they say Web3, why it matters, and tokens, the assets of the blockchain.

## What is Web3

In a nutshell, Web3 describes the next stage of internet that is more **open**, **transparent** and **permissionless** and runs on **decentralized** infrastructure such as **blockchains**

If web1 was a platform to consume content, and web2 saw people consuming content created from other people but owned by platforms built by tech giants, then web3 is a platform for consuming content that is created and owned by other people.

Instead of platforms owned by tech giants, people can use decentralized applications (Dapps) that are available globally.

## Why is Web3 important?

Web3 brings significant benefits and opportunities for those who are willing to invest the time.

### Benefits
    
- **Open** - in that they are built from open-source software, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed in full view of the world.
- **Trustless** - in that the network itself allows participants to interact publicly, or privately without a trusted third party
- **Permissionless** - in that anyone, both users and suppliers, can participate without authorisation from a governing body

### Opportunities

- Financial Tools (payments, fund raising, lending, borrowing,..)
- Identity solutions (self-sovereign, decentralized identifiers,..)
- More secure voting and governance mechanisms
- Efficient resources management (CO2 tracking, smart grid’s,..)
- Digital ownership registries (e.g. land, collectibles, NFT’s,..)
- Supply chain tracking 

## Blockchains

The defining infrastructure of Web3 are blockchains.

**A blockchain is a linked list of transactions stored on a network of computers.**
Blockchains are:

- Decentralized: Transactions are on a network of computers (nodes).
- Immutable: Transactions cannot be changed once committed.
- Open: Transactions can be viewed by anyone. 

## How blockchains work
Each block has:

- A list of transactions
- A hash (a long string of random characters) for the block
- The previous block’s hash (this is how the blocks are linked)

To make transactions, you need to use a crypto wallet. These wallets don’t actually store crypto assets. Instead, they store two keys:

A public key links to an address that lets you send and receive transactions. Think of it as your email address.
A private key proves that you own the tokens associated with your public address. Think of it as your email password. Since a private key is hard to remember (it’s a very long string of random numbers), wallets also give you a 12-24 word seed phrase. You shouldn't share your private key or seed phrase with anyone.

Bob would send Mary bitcoin in 3 steps:

Bob tells his wallet: "I want to send 1 bitcoin from my public address to Mary's public address." Bob signs this transaction based on his private key. This signature proves that Bob actually owns 1 bitcoin.
Bob's wallet sends the transaction to nodes on the blockchain. These nodes then verify the transaction using Bob’s signature and public key.
A node groups Bob’s transaction with other transactions into a block. It then works with other nodes to add the block to the blockchain.

## What is a token?

First let's define fungible and non-fungible assets

- **Fungible assets** are interchangeable (e.g., the US dollar, bitcoin).
- **Non-fungible assets** are unique (e.g., a piece of art, house deed, drivers license).

A token is a record of ownership of an asset.

- **Fungible tokens** are ones like bitcoin, ether, and atoms (in the cosmos network)
- **Non-fungible tokens** (NFTs) are unique
