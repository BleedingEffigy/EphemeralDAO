What is a crypto wallet? and how to set one up for Ethereum in 5 minutes?


When most people talk about wallets, they are referring to an application (browser extensions or mobile app) that lets you manage your crypto accounts

In Ethereum, accounts are the keypairs for a user-owned account.


A wallet application makes it easy to set up accounts on certain networks, move tokens around, approve and initiate transactions, and connect to web applications (Web3).

We'll be setting up accounts on both Ethereum, and we'll do so using Metamask




MetaMask is a popular browser-based wallet that makes it easy to allow web applications to interact with your Ethereum account.

1. Visit the official site metamask.io and follow the instructions for your browser

Here you can see:
1. Your current network. 
There's the Mainnet, sidechains like Polygon, and also multiple testnets for developers

2. Connection status

3. Your Wallet Address, public information, and safe to share.

⚠️Don't share your private key or seed phrase with anyone! ⚠️


Some websites use your wallet to talk to your blockchain account (these are called Dapps). They usually have a button like the below to prompt you for info about your account.


Here's an example of us signing into UniSwap.
First, we click the connect wallet button. 
At this point, most sites will prompt you to choose one of the multiple wallet apps to connect with.
We'll stick to using Metamask


Then you'll choose the account you want to connect with


Now on this last page, you'll review the permissions the website is asking you for. 
If it looks alright, go ahead and click connect.
Now you'll be connected to the site and officially using a dapp!


And that's it!
If you thought this was easy, wait until you see how to set up the Phantom wallet and start interacting with Solana!
