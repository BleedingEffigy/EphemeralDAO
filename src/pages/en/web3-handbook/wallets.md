## What is a crypto wallet? 
How to set up an Ethereum wallet in 5 minutes


When most people talk about wallets, they are referring to an application (browser extensions or mobile app) that lets you manage your crypto accounts

> In Ethereum, accounts are the keypairs for a user-owned account.

A wallet application makes it easy to set up accounts on certain networks, move tokens around, approve and initiate transactions, and connect to web applications (Web3).

We'll be setting up accounts on both Ethereum and Solana, and we'll do so using Metamask

MetaMask is a popular browser-based wallet that makes it easy to allow web applications to interact with your Ethereum account.

1. Visit the official site metamask.io and follow the instructions for your browser

Above we can see:
1. Your current network. There's the Mainnet, sidechains like Polygon, and also multiple testnets for developers
2. Connection status
3. Your Wallet Address, public information, and safe to share.

⚠️Don't share your private key or seed phrase with anyone! ⚠️


Some websites use your wallet to talk to your blockchain account (these are called Dapps). They usually have a button like the below to prompt you for info about your account.

At this point, most sites will prompt you to choose one of the multiple wallet apps to connect with.

Then you'll choose the account you want to connect with

If it looks alright, go ahead and click connect.
