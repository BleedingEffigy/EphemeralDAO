## Onboarding to Cryptofundamentals and Web3

A summary of the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sUpk0gbvRQelH0MUIOqjNeGe8nwRH4mhrhDHmI6qh4M/edit#slide=id.g442eb61d9d_0_710) by Patrick Rivera

### Eras of the Web

| Era | Companies | Description |
|-|-|-|
| **Web1**| Google, Amazon| Users consume content |
| **Web2** | Facebook, Uber | Users create content |
|**Web3** | Ethereum, OpenAI | User own content

Where Web3 and Crypto align is they both seek to:
- Use technology to help the disadvantaged
- Fix whatâ€™s wrong with the internet today

### Blockchain Architecture

**Current: Client <-> Server(owned by Some Company)**

 - Monopolistic, Single points of failure

**Blockchain: P2P Networks, Validators keep the network honest**

 - Decentralized governance & permissions, Global state, Multiple points of failure


Blockchain trades **technical scalability** for **social scalability**

**4 layers to understand blockchain:**

| Layer | Technology |
|-|-|
| 0 | Hardware & Networking (A Computer)|
| 1 | Consensus & Settlement (Bitcoin and Eth)|
| 2 | Smart Contracts (MAKER & UniSwap)|
| 3 | Wallets & UI (MetaMask & Compound)|


### Last 10 Years of Crypto

#### 3 waves of activity: 

|Years|Innovations|
|-|-|
| 2010-2012| Bitcoin, Architecture(Miners + Exchanges)|
| 2012-2016 | New L1 Blockchains, Privacy + Alt Coins|
| 2016-2020| DeFi, Layer2, Smart Wallet apps, NFT Marketplaces|

> There was rising skepticism after the 2018 crypto bubble crash.
But insiders realize each cycle brings the capital needed to invest in critical infrastructure:


##### Infrastructure innovations

- Decentralized Exchanges
- Lending Protocols
- L1 Blockchains
- Stablecoins
- Smart Wallets
- Developer Tools
- Storage Protocols

### Rise of NFTs

Currently, when you upload a file
The file is copied to an organizations backend

**One more time**
> Currently, when you upload a file
The file is copied to an organizations backend

Ownership is then transferred to that org

Blockchains enable
- Individual Ownership
- Public access
- Provenance
- Composability

#### How can NFT's help Creators?

Content creators can use NFT's to

- collect royalties from the trade of their asset
- grant benefits to holders
- create token-gated communities

### Future of NFTs
Is it the McRib NFT? **NO**

#### Creator DAO's
- Many ways of fundraising for projects
- Community-led decision making
- Transparent capital flows
- Employees and customers share in the upside
Starting a global corporation will be as simple as creating a group chat

#### Curator Economy

##### Most people on the internet are curators, not creators

**Traditional Curators (Magazines, Channels etc):**

- Opaque process
- tiny % of the population

**Future Curators:**

- More like angel investors
- Invest in projects you care about

##### Currently, we have
- Cryptocurrency
- Cryptofinance

##### Soon we will have
- Cryptosocial
- Cryptocommerce
- Cryptowork
- Cryptofirms
- Cryptostates
